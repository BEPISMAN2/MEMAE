# MEMAE: MUGEN Extractor Machine And Executor

##### What is this?
This is a simple Python script that somewhat automates the character installation process for you.  It simply installs all the characters in install/chars, edits the "select.def" file accordingly, then runs the game.

The script was intended for use with MUGEN 1.0, however, other versions (MUGEN 1.1, WinMUGEN, etc.) will probably also work with this script.

##### What do I need to run this?
You need Python 3 installed on your computer.  Python 2 won't work with this; you need Python 3.  Sorry to all Python 2 users.

##### What still needs to be implemented?
 - Stage .sff fixing (for uploaders who are too lazy to make sure their files are named properly)
 - Dropbox/URL/MEGA/Google Drive/Microsoft OneDrive/MediaFire Support (to simplify the process even further)
 
### DISCLAIMER:  THIS PYTHON SCRIPT IS STILL A WORK-IN-PROGRESS.  PLEASE BACK UP YOUR SELECT.DEF FILE BEFORE USING THIS.  I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DATA LOSS THAT MAY COME ABOUT AS A RESULT OF THIS PROGRAM.
